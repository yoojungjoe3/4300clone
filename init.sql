Two years later, while crossing from France all the way to the Caribbean, the ship that Regulus is on rescues a boy who is all but taken by the sea. The first thing that Regulus learns is that the boy is nice to look at. The second is that his name is James Potter. The third? James is a pirate. When Regulus is taken ten years later by the crew that his long lost brother used to call his own, a peculiar fellowship forms between a captain without a ship, a hero without an adventure and a blacksmith who has sworn to hate pirates for an eternity and more. Together they set out for a sweeping adventure involving old enemies, unlikely friendships and a love that will be legend for years to come. Sooner will the waves flow backwards before their lives will ever be the same."');
